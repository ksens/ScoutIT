abstract = {For various reasons, a projection dataset acquired on a computed tomography (CT) scanner can be truncated. That is, a portion of the scanned object is positioned outside the scan field-of-view (SFOV) and the line integrals corresponding to those regions are not measured. A projection truncation problem causes imaging artifacts that lead to suboptimal image quality. In this paper, we propose a reconstruction algorithm that enables an adequate estimation of the projection outside the SFOV. We make use of the fact that the total attenuation of each ideal projection in a parallel sampling geometry remains constant over views. We use the magnitudes and slopes of the projection samples at the location of truncation to estimate water cylinders that can best fit to the projection data outside the SFOV. To improve the robustness of the algorithm, continuity constraints are placed on the fitting parameters. Extensive phantom and patient experiments were conducted to test the robustness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Truncation artifacts in CT occur if the object to be imaged extends past the scanner field of view (SFOV). These artifacts impede diagnosis and could possibly introduce errors in dose plans for radiation therapy. Several approaches exist for correcting truncation artifacts, but existing correction algorithms do not accurately recover the skin line (or support) of the patient, which is important in some dose planning methods. The purpose of this paper was to develop an iterative algorithm that recovers the support of the object.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The authors assume that the truncated portion of the image is made up of soft tissue of uniform CT number and attempt to find a shape consistent with the measured data. Each known measurement in the sinogram is interpreted as an estimate of missing mass along a line. An initial estimate of the object support is generated by thresholding a reconstruction made using a previous truncation artifact correction algorithm (e.g., water cylinder extrapolation). This object support is iteratively deformed to reduce the inconsistency with the measured data. The missing data are estimated using this object support to complete the dataset. The method was tested on simulated and experimentally truncated CT data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The proposed algorithm produces a better defined skin line than water cylinder extrapolation. On the experimental data, the RMS error of the skin line is reduced by about 60{\%}. For moderately truncated images, some soft tissue contrast is retained near the SFOV. As the extent of truncation increases, the soft tissue contrast outside the SFOV becomes unusable although the skin line remains clearly defined, and in reformatted images it varies smoothly from slice to slice as expected.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The support recovery algorithm provides a more accurate estimate of the patient outline than thresholded, basic water cylinder extrapolation, and may be preferred in some radiation therapy applications.},

abstract = {In C-arm-based flat-detector computed tomography (FDCT) it frequently happens that the patient exceeds the scan field of view (SFOV) in the transaxial direction because of the limited detector size. This results in data truncation and CT image artefacts. In this work three truncation correction approaches for extended field-of-view (EFOV) reconstructions have been implemented and evaluated. An FDCT-based method estimates the patient size and shape from the truncated projections by fitting an elliptical model to the raw data in order to apply an extrapolation. In a camera-based approach the patient is sampled with an optical tracking system and this information is used to apply an extrapolation. In a CT-based method the projections are completed by artificial projection data obtained from the CT data acquired in an earlier exam. For all methods the extended projections are filtered and backprojected with a standard Feldkamp-type algorithm. Quantitative evaluations have been performed by simulations of voxelized phantoms on the basis of the root mean square deviation and a quality factor Q (Q = 1 represents the ideal correction). Measurements with a C-arm FDCT system have been used to validate the simulations and to investigate the practical applicability using anthropomorphic phantoms which caused truncation in all projections. The proposed approaches enlarged the FOV to cover wider patient cross-sections. Thus, image quality inside and outside the SFOV has been improved. Best results have been obtained using the CT-based method, followed by the camera-based and the FDCT-based truncation correction. For simulations, quality factors up to 0.98 have been achieved. Truncation-induced cupping artefacts have been reduced, e.g., from 218{\%} to less than 1{\%} for the measurements. The proposed truncation correction approaches for EFOV reconstructions are an effective way to ensure accurate CT values inside the SFOV and to recover peripheral information outside the SFOV.},

@article{SenSharma2013,
abstract = {Micro computed tomography (micro-CT) is a widely-used imaging technique. A challenge of micro-CT is to quantitatively reconstruct a sample larger than the field-of-view (FOV) of the detector. This scenario is characterized by truncated projections and associated image artifacts. However, for such truncated scans, a low resolution scout scan with an increased FOV is frequently acquired so as to position the sample properly. This study shows that the otherwise discarded scout scans can provide sufficient additional information to uniquely and stably reconstruct the interior region of interest. Two interior reconstruction methods are designed to utilize the multi-resolution data without significant computational overhead. While most previous studies used numerically truncated global projections as interior data, this study uses truly hybrid scans where global and interior scans were carried out at different resolutions. Additionally, owing to the lack of standard interior micro-CT phantoms, we designed and fabricated novel interior micro-CT phantoms for this study to provide means of validation for our algorithms. Finally, two characteristic samples from separate studies were scanned to show the effect of our reconstructions. The presented methods show significant improvements over existing reconstruction algorithms.},
