# Steps

1. Run the code:
```
1-MATLAB/xrec.m
```

2. Switch to Mathematica

This will run till the final block. Here since we did not have access to symbolic math toolbox of MATLAB, we switch to Mathematica. Run:
```
2-Mathematica/scoutIT-solution.nb
```

3. Complete the final steps in MATLAB

Plug the result computed in Mathematica, and plug it back into the MATLAB script to complete execution
